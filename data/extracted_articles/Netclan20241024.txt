The challenge is to develop a ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) dashboard that efficiently retrieves and displays Google Ads budget spent data on a campaign-wise basis using the Google Ads API. The current system lacks a streamlined method for tracking and analyzing ad spend across various campaigns, leading to difficulties in assessing performance and optimizing budget allocation. The goal is to create a comprehensive dashboard that accurately fetches and visualizes budget data, enabling more effective analysis and decision-making. This involves integrating with the Google Ads API, ensuring data accuracy, and providing clear, actionable insights for better campaign management.4o miniOur SolutionGet Data source accessa.
