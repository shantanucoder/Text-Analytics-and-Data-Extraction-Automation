We need to fetch currency data from that pure-clear API using python and need to store fetched data in Google Cloud Bigquery.We also need to automate the above process like the process runs on a daily basis and update the currency data on Bigquery.Our SolutionWe have created a python program that can fetch pure-clear API data. The API data was in JSON format but we needed table format so we used python package pandas. We converted json data to tabular format using pandas. After that, we connected python code to google cloud using google’s authentication module and then stored data frame (table) directly to BigQuery using the “.to_gbq” method.We also need to run the above process daily to update new data in BigQuery. For this Google cloud provides a “Cloud function” tool. In this, we can create a function and set up their running process. So we created a function and attached the above code to that function and set up a cloud function to run daily.Project DeliverablesA Google cloud function that runs daily and updates data on Google BigQueryTools usedCloud function, BigQuery of Google Cloud, Google Colab notebook, Python programming, PandasLanguage/techniques usedPython language and pandas moduleSkills usedPython programming, Data handling, Google CloudDatabases usedGoogle Cloud BigQueryWeb Cloud Servers usedGoogle Cloud ServerWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionConnecting google cloud to python code is challenging because Its credentials should be in a specified format otherwise it shows an authentication error.How the Technical Challenges were SolvedTo tackle this challenge we created a dictionary format (key-value pair) and stored all the authentication variables in the dictionary as a key value pair. Then we used google’s authentication library “google.auth” and passed a dictionary to the service_account method and stored it in different variables so we can store data from pandas dataframe to Google BigQuery.Project SnapshotsPrevious articleETL and MLOps Infrastructure for Blockchain AnalyticsNext articleDesign and develop solution to anomaly detection classification problemsAjay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORIntegrating Machine Learning Code into Kubeflow Pipeline – Kuberflow MLOps KubernetesFacial Recognition Attendance SystemFace Recognition Using DeepFaceMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSGrafana Dashboard – Oscar AwardsJuly 8, 2023Effective Management of Social Media Data Extraction: Strategies for Authentication, Security,...March 17, 2024Website Tracking and Insights using Google Analytics, & Google Tag ManagerJuly 1, 2022How Telehealth and Telemedicine helping people to fight against COVID-19April 28, 2022Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSWill we ever understand the nature of consciousness?A Leading Musical Instrumental, Website SEO & OptimizationCreate a Knowledge Graph to Provide Real-time Analytics, Recommendations, and a...Power BI Dashboard on Operations, Transactions, and Marketing Data, embedding the...
