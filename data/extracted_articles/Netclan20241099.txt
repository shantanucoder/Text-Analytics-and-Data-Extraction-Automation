First was the ingestion of existing data into the cloud-based CRM platform.2. Second was the question of automating the process of adding newer records to the cloud platform.Project DeliverablesThe client has been provided with python scripting handling bulk data ingestion to CRM and also the script to handle daily synchronization of data.Tools used– Python– MySQL Database– Postman– TeamViewerLanguage/techniques used– Automation– 3rdparty APIs– Authentication methods– Multi-Threading of function calls– bat Scripts for easier running of scripts for the clientModels usedPython Frameworks like requests to build own custom client for consumption of APIs.Skills usedPython Programming, Mult-threading, APIsDatabases usedThe client provided a MySQL instance.Web Cloud Servers usedZohoWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution?– Writing own client-side API-consumption code handling API calls from Authentication and Other Operations as per task requirements.– Debugging of API responses was messy.How the Technical Challenges were Solved– Multiple alternatives were discussed and implemented in python like conditional refreshing of API tokens.– Automation of daily synchronization handled by use of time deltas.– Logging of all operations to efficiently handle errors in the future.Business Impact– Automated workflow of the client– No need for dull tasks like data entry to CRM modules everything is taken care of using logic.URLhttps://www.exportgenius.in/Previous articleA web-based dashboard for the filtered data retrieval of land recordsNext articleTransform API into SDK library and widgetAjay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORIntegrating Machine Learning Code into Kubeflow Pipeline – Kuberflow MLOps KubernetesFacial Recognition Attendance SystemFace Recognition Using DeepFaceMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSDigital Strategic Foresight Platform – Smart AI-Driven DashboardFebruary 22, 2019Grafana Dashboard to visualize and analyze sensors’ dataFebruary 28, 2024Sentimental Analysis on Shareholder Letter of CompaniesAugust 22, 2021How big data & analytics is helping fashion e-tailers to capture...March 24, 2018Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSGrafana Dashboard to visualize and analyze sensors’ dataCan robots tackle late-life loneliness?Facial Recognition Attendance SystemManagement challenges for future digitalization of healthcare services
